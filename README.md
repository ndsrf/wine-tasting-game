## Game Flow

### For Directors

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account to manage games
2. **Create Game**: Set difficulty, number of wines, and wine details
3. **Share Code**: Distribute the 5-character game code to players
4. **Manage Game**: Control game phases and progression
5. **View Results**: Access final scores and detailed answer analysis

### For Players

1. **Join Game**: Enter game code and nickname (no registration required)
2. **Wait for Start**: See other players joining in real-time
3. **Play Rounds**: Guess wine characteristics across three phases per wine:
   - Visual characteristics
   - Smell characteristics
   - Taste characteristics
4. **See Results**: View final rankings and correct answers

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Director registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Director login
- `POST /api/auth/google` - Google OAuth authentication

### Games
- `POST /api/games/create` - Create new game (directors only)
- `GET /api/games/[code]` - Get game details
- `GET /api/games/[code]/results` - Get game results (finished games only)

## WebSocket Events

### Client to Server
- `join-game` - Join a game as player or director
- `start-game` - Start the game (directors only)
- `change-phase` - Change current phase (directors only)
- `next-wine` - Move to next wine (directors only)
- `submit-answer` - Submit player answers

### Server to Client
- `game-state` - Current game state
- `player-joined` - New player joined
- `game-started` - Game has started
- `phase-changed` - Phase transition
- `wine-changed` - Wine transition
- `answer-submitted` - Answer submission confirmation
- `error` - Error messages

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: Director accounts and authentication
- **games**: Game instances with settings and status
- **wines**: Wine details and AI-generated characteristics
- **players**: Player information and scores
- **answers**: Player responses and correctness

### Key Relationships
- Games belong to directors (users)
- Wines belong to games
- Players belong to games
- Answers link players to wines with characteristic types

## Deployment

**Note**: This application uses Socket.io for real-time functionality, which requires a persistent WebSocket connection. It is **not compatible** with serverless platforms like Vercel, AWS Lambda, or Netlify Functions. Deploy to a VPS or container platform instead.

### Docker Deployment

Public Docker images are available at `ghcr.io/ndsrf/wine-tasting-game`.

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method is recommended as it automatically sets up the application, PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache.

1.  Create a directory for your deployment, and `cd` into it.
    ```bash
    mkdir wine-tasting
    cd wine-tasting
    ```

2.  Create an `.env` file. You can use `.env.example` from the repository as a template. **Important:** For Docker Compose, ensure your `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` point to the service names (`postgres` and `redis` respectively), as shown in the example `.env` content in `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md`.

3.  Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository:
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndsrf/wine-tasting-game/main/docker-compose.yml
    ```

4.  Pull the latest images and start the services in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5.  Initialize the database by running the Prisma migration inside the running `app` container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app npx prisma db push
    ```

Your application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Option 2: Standalone Docker Container

Use this option if you are managing your own PostgreSQL and Redis instances.

1.  Ensure you have a `.env` file ready and that the `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` variables point to your existing database and Redis server.

2.  Pull the latest image from the GitHub Container Registry:
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/ndsrf/wine-tasting-game:latest
    ```

3.  Run the container, making sure to pass your environment file:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --name wine-tasting-app ghcr.io/ndsrf/wine-tasting-game:latest
    ```

4.  Initialize the database. You can do this by executing a command inside the running container:
    ```bash
    docker exec wine-tasting-app npx prisma db push
    ```

### VPS Deployment (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2, etc.)

```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh user@your-server-ip

# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd wine-tasting-game

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit with your values

# Set up database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server (use PM2 for process management)
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "wine-tasting" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```
